# Draft report for Denislav Stoynov

# Introduction:

Nowadays the development of technology is reaching a new very high-quality level that the world community has never faced before. People all over the world tend to use any type of technology in order to facilitate their life. There are lots of new-coming technology trends such as edge and quantum computing, virtual and augmented reality, blockchain, 5G and many others but one catches people and scientists’ attention to a large extent – modern robotics. Many of those people support the theory that robots will have mostly a negative impact over our life instead of a positive effect.

## Issues arising from using modern robotics in our daily lifestyle:

Society has always been concerned about the impact of modern robotics. There are bunch of positive features which may help for reduction in human errors, speeding up the production process in different working sectors, significant growth of economy, developing the level of digital assistance, inventing new and faster technologies and others but at the same time there are some arising issues that may reflect seriously on the world community.

In order to acquire more in-depth understanding and vision of the consequences of modern robotics and AI over the surrounding world, I watched ,,Alita: Battle Angel’’ 2019. The movie is about how people live along with robots and other AI advanced technologies several centuries in the future. In many of the scenes I have noticed some social, legal and ethical issues that could lead to a negative impact over the human civilization in our world.

- possibilities of programming errors occurrence or other serious problems that could make robots unpredictable and even dangerous for people themselves. 
- some power sources that have a direct communication with robots can bе disrupted, hence this can produce an energy releasing.
- mechanical failures should also be considered during the robot design stage because this mistake can also lead to a potentially dangerous situation for the surrounding people.

Furthermore, there are lots of social, legal and ethical issues which can affect our life – growing dehumanization in physical facilities and stores, disappearance of jobs, misinformation and fake news, lack of trust and many others.

### Legal aspects:

There are many questions that can occur when talking about legal aspects of modern robotics. 
For example, if we take a look at the autopilot feature, provided by Tesla cars, we can immediately ask ourselves who will be responsible for any errors or defective work and more precisely who should be blamed if the autopilot causes harm to a person or a property (e.g., car crashes). 

Another fact that can be described as a legal issue is the way robots can collect and store personal data. AI machines often respond to visual and audio signals by utilizing special microphones, cameras, or speakers. In this way, they might derive personal data which needs to be stored securely in order to prevent information leakage.

Third social issue that should be taken into account is regarding to the robot behavior towards people. In case of any unexpected problems, caused by lack of attention during programming process in the algorithm, the robot itself might become aggressive and may be harmful for the surrounding objects and people. Issues like this could be a common part in the sphere of modern robotics, due to the dynamic of working with AI, hence in this case we start wondering who will be liable for any inflicted damage.

The next social issue is the lack of algorithmic transparency. In fact, this can be described as a significant issue due to the fact that if the robot / AI is directly connected with the government or any other high-ranking authorities there should be a complete transparency of the algorithm, how it works, its design, weaknesses, high-risk areas and other relevant parts.[3]

### Ethical aspects:

One of the most common ethical issues that would people face is the large number of unemployed people. There is a prediction, made by Oxford Economics, through which they announce that:[2]

>Up to 20 million manufacturing jobs around the world could be replaced by robots by 2030. 

This means that in the near future many and many people will have a hard time finding appropriate jobs in their sphere due to saturated working sector with artificial intelligence and robotics.

Another crucial ethical issue is cybersecurity. This is a very big concern for lots of government systems and companies – mostly banks. For instance, robots can help protect vulnerabilities in bank systems, but hackers may find other methods of attacking and stealing money. This can cause both material and mental damage to people.

Is it ethical enough to let robots have rights? If we look at the robots as a human-like object we would say yes. Actually, there are three main laws of robotics, developed by Isaac Asimov:[1]

- a robot is not allowed to attack and injure humans
- a robot is obliged to fulfil any orders, given by humans
- a robot must protect itself

Now if we refer to some of the legal issues, we could confirm that robots should not have rights since there is a huge chance of breaking one of the third laws. In case of any algorithm errors, this may have a counter-effect over the robot, and it could acquire very dangerous behavior towards human-beings.

AI in military is also considered as an important ethical aspect of the modern robotics sector. In fact, military robots are either autonomous or remote-controlled AI that are invented to be used in tough situations such as transport, rescue, attacks, long-lasting searches and others. In military is utilized autonomous weapons and often those guns are used not under human observance but this can result in severe military robotics and AI race.

### Social aspects:

Currently, almost every person prefers to spend more time using technology instead of meeting with other people and create real contacts. The high usage of robots and AI for the new-coming technologies may even prevent people from communicating with others completely which will lead to negative effects over our health.

Moreover, another social issue is the growing dehumanization all over the world. People’s qualities and skills will become much more underestimated at the expense of robotics. Robots will be used in all areas as they will become an integral part of the world.
