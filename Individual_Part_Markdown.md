# Draft report for Denislav Stoynov

# Introduction:
Nowadays the development of technology is reaching a new very high-quality level that the world community has never faced before. People all over the world tend to use any type of technology in order to facilitate their life. There are lots of new-coming technology trends such as edge and quantum computing, virtual and augmented reality, blockchain, 5G and many others but one catches people and scientists’ attention to a large extent – modern robotics. Many of those people support the theory that robots will have mostly a negative impact over our life instead of a positive effect.
## Issues arising from using modern robotics in our daily lifestyle:
Society has always been concerned about the impact of modern robotics. There are bunch of positive features but at the same time there are some arising issues that may reflect seriously to the world community such as:
- possibilities of programming errors occurrence or other serious problems that could make robots unpredictable and even dangerous for people themselves. 
- some power sources that have a direct communication with robots can bå disrupted, hence this can produce an energy releasing.
- mechanical failures should also be considered during the robot design stage because this mistake can also lead to a potentially dangerous situation for the surrounding people.
Furthermore, there are lots of social, legal and ethical issues which can affect our life – growing dehumanization in physical facilities and stores, disappearance of jobs, misinformation and fake news, lack of trust and many others.
### Legal aspects:
There are many questions that can occur when talking about legal aspects of modern robotics. 
For example, if we take a look at the autopilot feature, provided by Tesla cars, we can immediately ask ourselves who will be responsible for any errors or defective work and more precisely who should be blamed if the autopilot causes harm to a person or a property (e.g., car crashes). 
Another fact that can be described as a legal issue is the way robots can collect and store personal data. AI machines often respond to visual and audio signals by utilizing special microphones, cameras, or speakers. In this way, they might derive personal data which needs to be stored securely in order to prevent information leakage.

### Ethical aspects:
One of the most common ethical issues that would people face is the large number of unemployed people. There is a prediction, made by Oxford Economics, through which they announce that ,,up to 20 million manufacturing jobs around the world could be replaced by robots by 2030’’. This means that in the near future many and many people will have a hard time finding appropriate jobs in their sphere due to saturated working sector with artificial intelligence.
Another crucial ethical issue is cybersecurity. This is a very big concern for lots of government systems and companies – mostly banks. For instance, robots can help protect vulnerabilities in bank systems, but hackers may find other methods of attacking and stealing money. This can cause both material and mental damage to people.
### Social aspects:
Currently, almost every person prefers to spend more time using technology instead of meeting with other people and create real contacts. The high usage of robots and AI for the new-coming technologies may even prevent people from communicating with others completely which will lead to negative effects over our health.
Moreover, another social issue is the growing dehumanization all over the world. People’s qualities and skills will become much more underestimated at the expense of robotics. Robots will be used in all areas as they will become an integral part of the world.
