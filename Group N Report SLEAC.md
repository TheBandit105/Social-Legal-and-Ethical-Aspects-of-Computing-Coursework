## Introduction

The main topic of the report involves the general implications and considerations required as robotics become more sophisticated. A plethora of different sectors are considered within the context of social, legal and ethical considerations and how it will impact society in the future. Subtopics include the military, police and health. We watched a movie called 'Alita:Battle Angel', based on a future with advanced technologies and robotics. The movie provided a good comparison to the current state of robotic situation as it shows a potential approach to how humans would live amongst these machines. The film was able to convey a diverse group of areas robotics could be utilised including the military, police and health care. It also considers how robots may make decisions. 

## Analysis

### Government

WW2 is a great example of the first use of robotics in warfare. Robots, like US's 'Aphrodite' drones, were not effective in carrying out every task that their commanders have ordered them to do. It wasn't until the 1990's that robotics for military operations fully commenced with the MQB-1 Predator drone used by the CIA. These drones could be controlled by satellite through any command post to cover intelligence gaps. 

Whilst the progress in making the robots intelligent from 1940s to the 1990s is quite incredible, such robots don't have the capacity to react appropriately in unpredictable scenarios. This has a lot of legal issues behind this as this could lead to the human personnel getting involved to stop the robots from causing unwanted damage. If we were to develop a body like the 'Berserker' in 'Alita:Battle Angel', it would have legal and ethical impacts. 

First, we would need to find a way to connect the human head to the robotic body, which could be seen as ethically and morally wrong. This is because some religions, such as Islam dictate that the human body should be treated with the upmost respect and no harm should come to it.

It has also been shown that the question of armed autonomous machines within the context of law enforcement services. There are a lot of implications with law enforcement utilising robots for situations that may involve the use of weapons. The primary issue with this is potentially allowing an individuals life be determined by an algorithm. Given robots do not have conscience their actions are determined by algorithms they are programmed with. Due to the exact nature of an algorithm this removes context from situations which could lead to an increase in deaths caused by law enforcement services. It also leads to the question of who's at fault in the situation of an error.

Armed robots for law enforcement also cause a shift in the social view of law enforcement, with a larger adoption of machines for law enforcement purpose this could cause a de-humanisation of the law enforcement. De-humanisation could lead to a greater divide between the people and the Government, this is evident already from reports.

### Minds

As the world tries to find newer and more efficient ways of creating robotics, one of the main topics involving robotics is the ability for them to evaluate situations similar to a human's thought process. Due to the robotics being programmed as algorithms to be used on everyday tasks or specific tasks, scientists are outlining how a robot can be taught to navigate a maze by using electric flows serving as brain nerve cells connected to the machine.

Whilst its morally wrong as some religions would see this as playing as 'god' its also ethically wrong as the questions goes; will robots be able to tell the difference between us and them?. In the movie 'Alita:Battle Angel', it is shown the world being insanely advanced technologically and shows robotics in the form of citizen protection. If these sort of robotics existed in the real world, it would arise many questions, one being will it be able to make the correct choice instead of following a script such as if criminal, arrest as the movie showed a similar situation to which the robot followed through the wrong decision for the plot. This shows the robot was following an alogrithmic mindset instead of being able to process like us and seeing how an algorithm can be faulty, giving robotics the ability to make their own decisions and 'live' will cause robotics to step away for the real purpose their created.  Another seen in the movie shows the robot almost stepping on a dog and the main character, showing we humans would have to avoid the robots as they won't think of us as objects to avoid.

Alongside the negatives surrounding robotic decision processes, it can also be beneficial. As shown in the movie, the robotics in role protect most civilians and is used as a way of protection as the movie also references that the police do not exist and is about bounty hunters and these protecting machines. If these machines were to be implemented in real life situations it can protect people and reduce crime in the future. Alongside cyborgs exisiting, while having the ability to think like us, it means these cyborgs can live amongst us and also help us with daily tasks and more.
