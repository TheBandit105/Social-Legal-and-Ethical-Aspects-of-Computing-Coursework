## Introduction

The main topic of the report was that we discussed about the robots in general. We looked into different aspects of the robots and how it will impact our societies in the future. Subtopics include the military, police, health etc. We watched a movie called 'Alita:Battle Angel' and is based on a future with highly advanced technologies and robotics. This movie became a good comparison to real life robotic situation as it shows their way of how humans would live amongst these AIs. Alita, was able to show their interpretation of how the military advanced, police, health care, AI mindset and the everyday lives of these technologies.
