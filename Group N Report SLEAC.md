## Introduction

The main topic of the report involves the general implications and considerations required as robotics become more sophisticated. A plethora of different sectors are considered within the context of social, legal and ethical considerations and how it will impact society in the future. Subtopics include the military, police and health. We watched a movie called 'Alita:Battle Angel', based on a future with advanced technologies and robotics. The movie provided a good comparison to the current state of robotic situation as it shows a potential approach to how humans would live amongst these machines. The film was able to convey a diverse group of areas robotics could be utilised including the military, police and health care. It also considers how robots may make decisions. 

## Analysis

### Government

WW2 is a great example of the first use of robotics in warfare. Robots, like US's 'Aphrodite' drones, were not effective in carrying out every task that their commanders have ordered them to do. It wasn't until the 1990's that robotics for military operations fully commenced with the MQB-1 Predator drone used by the CIA. These drones could be controlled by satellite through any command post to cover intelligence gaps. 

Whilst the progress in making the robots intelligent from 1940s to the 1990s is quite incredible, such robots don't have the capacity to react appropriately in unpredictable scenarios. This has a lot of legal issues behind this as this could lead to the human personnel getting involved to stop the robots from causing unwanted damage. If we were to develop a body like the 'Berserker' in 'Alita:Battle Angel', it would have legal and ethical impacts. 

First, a method of connecting the human head to a robotic body, which could potentially be ethically and morally wrong. This is because religions, such as Islam dictate that the human body should be treated with the upmost respect and no harm should come to it.

It has also been shown that the question of armed autonomous machines within the context of law enforcement services. There are a lot of implications with law enforcement utilising robots for situations that may involve the use of weapons. The primary issue with this is potentially allowing an individuals life be determined by an algorithm. Given robots do not have conscience their actions are determined by algorithms they are programmed with. Due to the exact nature of an algorithm this removes context from situations which could lead to an increase in deaths caused by law enforcement services. It also leads to the question of who's at fault in the situation of an error.

Armed robots for law enforcement also cause a shift in the social view of law enforcement, with a larger adoption of machines for law enforcement purpose this could cause a de-humanisation of the law enforcement. De-humanisation could lead to a greater divide between the people and the Government, this is evident already from reports.
>New York City councilmember Ben Kallos says he "watched in horror" last month when city police responded to a hostage situation in the Bronx using Boston Dynamics' Digidog, a remotely operated robotic dog equipped with surveillance cameras.

Key questions with regards to the legality autonomous machine are already being considered such as what "Reasonable force" would be for a machine. Some areas are even creating legal documents to directly address this issue such as within New York.

There is also the social aspect of robotics being used within the police force. The key concern here is whether a machine would enforce true equality. Depending on the data that the machines have been trained on their could be potential bias within the data leading to inequality when it comes to correctly identify illegal activity. This presents the problem of how to handle human bias within a machine. Given a situation where a human officer would have to make a decision that would reflect their personality, a machine is unable to reason to this degree and could lead to incorrect outcomes.

Despite the concerns surrounding the implementation of autonomous machines within the police force there are several potential benefits to this approach. The main benefit of using a machine in place of a human is it reduces the frequency of casualties for the police force. Similarly allowing machines to deal with the more dangerous situations it would allow human officers to focus more on the general wellbeing of the public. Another viewpoint could be due to the algorithmic nature of machines there may be a social perception that machines are more consistent and efficient in contrast to the viewpoint that police officers are lazy, there is also the idea that a robot would have less error in comparison to a human officer, whilst this isn't necessarily true the general perception of robots is that they are consistent and accurate.

### Minds

As the world tries to find newer and more efficient ways of creating robotics, one of the main topics involving robotics is the ability for them to evaluate situations similar to a human's thought process. Due to the robotics being programmed as algorithms to be used on everyday tasks or specific tasks, scientists are outlining how a robot can be taught to navigate a maze by using electric flows serving as brain nerve cells connected to the machine.

Whilst it could be considered morally wrong with some religions due to the view of playing as 'god' it's also ethically wrong as the question goes; will robots be able to tell the difference between us and them?. In the movie 'Alita:Battle Angel', it is shown the world being insanely advanced technologically and shows robotics in the form of citizen protection. If these sort of robotics existed in the real world, it would arise many questions, one being will it be able to make the correct choice instead of following a script such as if criminal, arrest as the movie showed a similar situation to which the robot followed through the wrong decision for the plot. This shows the robot was following an alogrithmic mindset instead of being able to process like us and seeing how an algorithm can be faulty, giving robotics the ability to make their own decisions and 'live' will cause robotics to step away for the real purpose their created.  Another seen in the movie shows the robot almost stepping on a dog and the main character, showing we humans would have to avoid the robots as they won't think of us as objects to avoid.

Alongside the negatives surrounding robotic decision processes, it can also be beneficial. As shown in the movie, the robotics in role protect most civilians and is used as a way of protection as the movie also references that the police do not exist and is about bounty hunters and these protecting machines. If these machines were to be implemented in real life situations it can protect people and reduce crime in the future. Alongside cyborgs exisiting, while having the ability to think like us, it means these cyborgs can live amongst us and also help us with daily tasks and more.

### Medicine & Rehabilitaion

As technology continues to improve it gradually becomes embedded within all sectors. The medical sector is a clear example of this, a key area of artificial intelligence for computer vision is to identify medical images. The current technology within the medical sector predominantly acts as an assistant for a qualified individual.
>The robotic system in surgery is currently a robotic-assisted operation; a slave device that is nothing more than a tool and an extension of the surgeon (12).

Whilst fully autonomous machines are not used within surgeries currently there are still a significant number of factors to evaluate if it could be achieved. From the perspective of the general public there are several different perspectives to be considered and how comfortable a patient would feel being treated by a robot reflect this. From one perspective there could potentially be a lack of trust in the machine in performing the surgery needed, this could be due to a lack of faith within the technology the robot consists of. 

Another consideration is how to establish when a machine is suitable enough to be deployed within a real environment. For surgeries that could lead to fatality if done wrong how would a robot be trained to handle the situation, further to this point how certain can a manufacturer be that the training transfers directly to operating on a human patient.
