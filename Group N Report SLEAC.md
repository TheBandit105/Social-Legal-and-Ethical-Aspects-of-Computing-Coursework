## Introduction

The main topic of the report was that we discussed about the robots in general. We looked into different aspects of the robots and how it will impact our societies in the future. Subtopics include the military, police, health etc. We watched a movie called 'Alita:Battle Angel' and is based on a future with highly advanced technologies and robotics. This movie became a good comparison to real life robotic situation as it shows their way of how humans would live amongst these AIs. Alita, was able to show their interpretation of how the military advanced, police, health care, AI mindset and the everyday lives of these technologies. 

## Analysis

### Government

WW2 is a great example of the first use of robotics in warfare. Such robots, like US's 'Aphrodite' drones, were not effective in carrying out every task that their commanders have ordered them to do. It wasn't until the 1990's that robotics for military operations fully commenced with the MQB-1 Predator drone used by the CIA. These drones could be controlled by satellite through any command post to cover intelligence gaps. 

Whilst the progress in making the robots intelligent from 1940s to the 1990s is quite incredible, such robots dont have the capacity to react appropriately in unpredictable scenarios. This has a lot of legal issues behind this as this could lead to the human personnel getting involved to stop the robots from causing unwanted damage. If we were to develop a body like the 'Berserker' in 'Alita:Battle Angel', it would have legal and ethical impacts. 

First, we would need to find a way to connect the human head to the robotic body, which could be seen as ethically and morally wrong. This is because some religions, such as Islam dictate that the human body should be treated with the upmost respect and no harm should come to it.

### Minds

As the world tries to find newer and more efficient ways of creating robotics, one of the main topics involving robotics is the ability for them to think as humans and become as similar as possible. Due to robotics being programmed as algorithms to be used on everyday tasks or specific tasks, scientists are outlining how a robot can be taught to navigate a maze by using electric flows serving as brain nerve cells connected to the machine.

Whilst its morally wrong as some religions would see this as playing as 'god' its also ethically wrong as the questions goes; will robots be able to tell the difference between us and them?. In the movie 'Alita:Battle Angel', it is shown the world being insanely advanced technologically and shows robotics in the form of citizen protection. If these sort of robotics existed in the real world, it would arise many questions, one being will it be able to make the correct choice instead of following a script such as if criminal, arrest as the movie showed a similar situation to which the robot followed through the wrong decision for the plot. This shows the robot was following an alogrithmic mindset instead of being able to process like us and seeing how an algorithm can be faulty, giving robotics the ability to make their own decisions and 'live' will cause robotics to step away for the real purpose their created.  Another seen in the movie shows the robot almost stepping on a dog and the main character, showing we humans would have to avoid the robots as they won't think of us as objects to avoid.

Alongside the negatives about the idea of robotics being able to think like us, it can also be beneficial. As shown in the movie, the robotics in role protect most civilians and is used as a way of protection as the movie also references that the police do not exist and is about bounty hunters and these protecting machines. If these machines were to be implemented in real life situations it can protect people and reduce crime in the future. Alongside cyborgs exisiting, while having the ability to think like us, it means these cyborgs can live amongst us and also help us with daily tasks and more.
