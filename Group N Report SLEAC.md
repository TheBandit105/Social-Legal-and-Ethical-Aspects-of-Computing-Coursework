## Introduction

The main topic of the report was that we discussed about the robots in general. We looked into different aspects of the robots and how it will impact our societies in the future. Subtopics include the military, police, health etc. We watched a movie called 'Alita:Battle Angel' and is based on a future with highly advanced technologies and robotics. This movie became a good comparison to real life robotic situation as it shows their way of how humans would live amongst these AIs. Alita, was able to show their interpretation of how the military advanced, police, health care, AI mindset and the everyday lives of these technologies. 

## Analysis

### Government

WW2 is a great example of the first use of robotics in warfare. Such robots, like US's 'Aphrodite' drones, were not effective in carrying out every task that their commanders have ordered them to do. It wasn't until the 1990's that robotics for military operations fully commenced with the MQB-1 Predator drone used by the CIA. These drones could be controlled by satellite through any command post to cover intelligence gaps. 

Whilst the progress in making the robots intelligent from 1940s to the 1990s is quite incredible, such robots dont have the capacity to react appropriately in unpredictable scenarios. This has a lot of legal issues behind this as this could lead to the human personnel getting involved to stop the robots from causing unwanted damage. If we were to develop a body like the 'Berserker' in 'Alita:Battle Angel', it would have legal and ethical impacts. 

First, we would need to find a way to connect the human head to the robotic body, which could be seen as ethically and morally wrong. This is because some religions, such as Islam dictate that the human body should be treated with the upmost respect and no harm should come to it.
