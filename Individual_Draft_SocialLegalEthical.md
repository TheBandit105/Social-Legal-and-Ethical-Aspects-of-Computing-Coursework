## Issues arising from Robotics being taught to think like us

Artificial Intelligence and robotics are digital technologies that has a major importance on the development of the future and how we humans will live them and process these changes. Due to their functionality and importance, alot of ethical and legal issues have been arised and are arising on how they work, what they work with, the risks involved and the control of it.
As AI is created by humans, and robotics too, their minds/brains are based on algorithms in the form of electronic circuitry performing millions of operations every second. While it is similar to our brains and minds, they are debated on being living organisms. The movie "Alita: Battle Angel" represents the main protagonist as a cyborg. A cyborg is 'a person whos physical abilities are extended with the use of mechanical elements planted onto the body', and these mechanical elements require a connection to the brain to then be used by the human, making them half robot and half human. The movie shows a futuristic setting and the life of humans where AI is a norm technology and is running the world. Police security shown in the movie is in the form of robotic machines detecing crime around the world and react depending on the sort of crime, giving them human like mindsets and choices which make them very similar to humans. In the movie, it is also shown that robotic machines are not treated as humans and shows that despite robotics are a norm, humans still control the world and not machines.

### Legal Aspects
One of the main legal issues of these technologies is how privacy is inflicted. Depending on the work these AI and robotics handle, privacy is a concern to look out for. Privacy and surveillance has many concerns, the main being data access as almost all data is now digital due to data collection and is vulnerable to breachments.
Will these experiments of testing robotics with human thinking abilities have the right authorisation by the standing governance
How will these robotics be maintained as it becomes fundamental for longevity and productivity. As robots are taught to think like us, reguler updates are required to make sure these robotics are accurate to humans as possible. 
A contingency plan is required especially if the situation requires a new solution which the robotics have not learnt on how to tackle. 

### Ethical Aspects
Due to robotics being as advanced as humans in certain situations, unemployment is a major concern, if these robotics are to think like humans, it can cause alot of issues including humans to then rely on robotics instead.
Will there be equality within the robotics system? will jobs prefer a robot more than a human or will they be treated equally?
As robotics are human made, they are prone to articial problems. Teaching a robot to think like us can become complex and cause issues when the situation is not programmed or known to the robot.
Will robotics have rights as humans as they also think like us? as these robotics can think like us will they be treated like humans and will their rights be valid just like us?
