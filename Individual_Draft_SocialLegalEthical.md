## Issues arising from Robotics being taught to think like us

Artificial Intelligence and robotics are digital technologies that has a major importance on the development of the future and how we humans will live them and process these changes. Due to their functionality and importance, alot of ethical and legal issues have been arised and are arising on how they work, what they work with, the risks involved and the control of it. [1]

In the movie 'Alita: Battle Angel', it is shown the world being insanely advanced technologically and shows robotics in the form of citizen protection. If these sort of robotics existed in the real world, it would arise many questions, one being will it be able to make the correct choice instead of following a script such as if criminal, arrest as the movie showed a similar situation to which the robot followed through the wrong decision for the plot. This shows the robot was following an algorithmic mindset instead of being able to process like us and seeing how an algorithm can be faulty, giving robotics the ability to make their own decisions and 'live' will cause robotics to step away for the real purpose their created. Another scene in the movie shows the robot almost stepping on a dog and the main character, showing we humans would have to avoid the robots as they won't think of us as objects to avoid

As AI is created by humans, and robotics too, their minds/brains are based on algorithms in the form of electronic circuitry performing millions of operations every second[4]. While it is similar to our brains and minds, they are debated on being living organisms. The movie "Alita: Battle Angel" represents the main protagonist as a cyborg. A cyborg is 'a person whos physical abilities are extended with the use of mechanical elements planted onto the body', and these mechanical elements require a connection to the brain to then be used by the human, making them half robot and half human. The movie shows a futuristic setting and the life of humans where AI is a norm technology and is running the world. Police security shown in the movie is in the form of robotic machines detecing crime around the world and react depending on the sort of crime, giving them human like mindsets and choices which make them very similar to humans. In the movie, it is also shown that robotic machines are not treated as humans and shows that despite robotics are a norm, humans still control the world and not machines.

### Legal Aspects
One of the main legal issues of these technologies is how privacy is inflicted. Depending on the work these AI and robotics handle, privacy is a concern to look out for. Privacy and surveillance have many concerns, the main being data access as almost all data is now digital due to data collection and is vulnerable to any sort of breachments. This arises the concerns on what these robotic minds can react with and how they will react as tech is never safe for humans due to its loopholes and reliability [2]. As robotics are created by humans it is prone to intentional problems for personal gains too.

Will these experiments of testing robotics with human thinking abilities have the right authorisation by the standing governance?
How will these robotics be maintained as it becomes fundamental for longevity and productivity? As robots are taught to think like us, reguler updates are required to make sure this robotics are accurate to humans as possible. 
A contingency plan is required especially if the situation requires a new solution which the robotics have not learnt on how to tackle. [2] 

if robotics were to be created as advanced as humans with the ability to think like humans and any other living organisms, their rights are questioned. So far in the EU no rights [5] have been directly been granted to artificial machines and in the near future would be questioned by the government, the creators and humans. It is also discussed that humans come first before technology but what if that were to change, it would change the future and be related to the theories of robots taking over the world.

### Ethical Aspects
Due to robotics being as advanced as humans in certain situations, unemployment is a major concern, if this robotics are to think like humans, it can cause alot of issues including humans to then rely on robotics instead.[3]
Will there be equality within the robotics system? will jobs prefer a robot more than a human or will they be treated equally? [3]
As robotics are human made, they are prone to articial problems. Teaching a robot to think like us can become complex and cause issues when the situation is not programmed or known to the robot. [3]

Will robotics have rights as humans as they also think like us? as this robotics can think like us will they be treated like humans, and will their rights be valid just like us? [3] These all are questions to which humans would ask in the future becoming a norm for robotic AI’s as it does question our own morals as we already treat all living organisms thus if robotics think like us and are like us, would they be considered as living organisms? Because if that’s the case, it would divide the world especially in religion as this would be considered an act in playing as god.

One of many issues ethically is what if it becomes a norm for robotic AI’s to think like us, feel like us and become like us, would they be considered as living organisms? Because if that’s the case, it would divide the world especially in religion as this would be considered an act in playing as god. As this majorly affects religious ethics, it would be denied to be accepted into society by multiple groups of people, if they were added to society however they would be treated as other living organisms such as animals but not be related to humans in any form or factor, thus only a minority of religious groups then accepting robotics with a different title.
