## Challenges in robotic and AI assisted medical procedures and rehabilitation

### Advantages of robotic and AI in medical practices



### Legal Aspects



### Ethical Aspects 

Although the use of AI and robotics in medical practices has a lot of advantges for healthcare in the future, it also raises ethical issues which needs to be taken into account. One ethical factor that needs to be considered when using a robotic surgical system is how informed consent is going to be incoporated in order to give the patients enough information to agree on whether they want to go through with a procedure. Another ethical issue we need to consider is the patients' surgeon and rehabilitation counselor preference, although some people find it useful to use AI and robotics, some may have misconceptions about it and some may just prefer to have a patient-clinician relationship. 

One factor that falls under the four pillars of medical ethics is justice which needs to be taken into account when creating algorithmic AI systems. This is because there could be a risk with AI being biased and therefore lead to discrimination due to the fact that human-trained algorithms could include datasets from a biased standpoint. 

Data privacy issues also need to be considered when dealing with AI in the medical field for patient confidentiality, which means patients need to be informed how and where their data is being used and also consent for their data to be used.
