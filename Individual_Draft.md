## Issues arising from Police Usage of armed robots

As technology progresses and becomes more sophisticated their inclusion within societies increases. A key example of this is the involvement of autonomous machines within the police force. Whilst on the surface utilising machines seems reasonable issues arise as the tasks delegated to them become more involved. Machines armed with weapons create a series of problems from both social, legal and ethical perspectives.

Alita: battle angel is a film set in the far future, within this reality there are autonomous machines living amongst humans like equals. Machines also take a large role within enforcing law within the society through means such as bounty hunting. The role machines have within Alita hold parallels with the potential roles machines are being considered for within our society providing a direct perspective of potential consequences of the adopting of advanced machinery within roles of high importance.

### Legal aspects

A primary issue that arises when robots are permitted to detain individuals with force is the implications of how they come to conclusions that prompt them to use their destructive power. Depending on the algorithms within the robots to identify danger there could be implicit racism or bias from the training data which would lead to un-lawful acts or a prejudice to use force against a certain type of individual.

Another key legal implication is that a plethora of regulation will be required for the machines. The security of machine will be a major consideration, if an armed robot was hacked and became controlled by individuals with malicious purposes serious crimes could be committed. The blame would also be shared between the hacker and those who developed the security mechanism within the robot. On top of security regulations the quality of the weapons the robots possess will require significant regulation to ensure that robots are only given the amount of force necessary for a given situation. Data protection laws will also have to be enforced with these machines.

If machines were given an even greater role within the police similar to one of the roles they occupy within Alita even more considerations would be needed with regards to the law and regulations. Due to the significance of fully-armed machines being given the role of goverment would potentially need to be considered on a global scale, the implication of machines sophisticated enough to reliably enforce law could potentially cause concern for other countries akin to the severity of nuclear weaponry.

### Ethical aspects

With allowing robots the ability to derive conclusions as to whether or not to harm an individual in certain situations it provides robots with a larger responsibility than prior and with the lack of emotions robots are less like to be reasonable in specific situations where a human officer can make implicit deductions.

From the perspective of the public the law being enforced by machines could be daunting and create a larger divide between law enforcement and the public.
The article listed references this issue clearly.
> remote policing could worsen an "us-versus-them" divide.

Further to this point it portrays the law enforcement as a much more authoritarian environment and could lead others to fear government due to thoughts of dictatorships or corruption.

Utilisation of machines to replace a human operator in certain situations provides benefits; armed robots for situations that would normally require a SWAT team mean that there are likely to be fewer casualties on the side of the law enforcement. This must be considered and evaluated alongside the potentially side-effects of utilising machines. If a machine is more likely to resort to utilising weapons than a human operator whilst police members will not get injured it could lead to a larger amount of individuals injured by the police.

Despite the ethical issues associated, to make a definitive decision on the suitability of inclusion of these armed machines the benefits the machines produce would also have to be evaluated. The key benefit of utilising armed robots within dangerous situations would be officers are in situations that could lead to injury less frequently. Similarly with machines being given a more substantial role within policing it provides human officers more time to focus on jobs that may have frequently gone overlooked before due to the priority it preventing crimes that could lead to loss in life. 


Despite the potential concerns surrounding robotics within policing the use of these machines can provide a significant amount of benefits. A signifcant topic of discussion currently is the proficiency lack of resources available within the police-force. In this regard utilising automation would provide a greater breadth of work that can be achieved within police force.
> Successful robotic process automation (RPA) programmes tend to focus not on replacing jobs, but on automating repetitive tasks and processes wherever they are found. 
Similarly to addressing the more repetitive tasks use within more involved situations that could lead to injury would provide benefit by reducing the number of injuries officers get during work. There are a large number of steps involved in embedding automation into any work environment. The main priority in the beginning involves ensuring the human operators can place most of their focus and productivity on the key tasks. This has the benefit of not compromising the jobs themselves which is a key concern for a lot of individuals in the context of automation and robotics.

> Leave humans to make important decisions
One interesting observation that the UK government are taken to gradually increase automation within the police is to prioritise humans to make the key decisions and similarly ensuring that any robotic activity is clearly recorded. This approach directly addresses some of the issues raised within the report, it provides clear goals as well as informs society that this process is being considered carefully and any faults caused by robots can be directly linked to them.

>Law enforcement agencies should dedicate time to identify, structure, categorize
and share their needs in terms of AI and robotics, so as to facilitate the development
of projects
All of these aspects are gradually being considered as the reality of autonomous armed machines progresses. On issue within the system is AI and robotics are a rapidly developing area creating further difficulties in regards to adapting to the technology. This presents a challenge that will need to be overcome if the police force aims to utilise AI and robotics to its full potential. 

## Conclusions 

To conclude as machines become more sophisticated and are granted a greater responsibility within society a great amount of aspects of life will need to adapt to these developments. One key discussion will be the general perception of robots when used for situations of agression. A significant amount of the public will be against the automation of armed policing due to fears of a goverment gaining further control over it's citizens. The process of robots becoming involved within the police force will be gradual and careful, there are a number of areas to consider and at each stage adjustment will be required from all parties involved.
