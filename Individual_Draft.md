## Challenges in robotic and AI assisted medical procedures and rehabilitation

### Abstract

Throughout the movie "Alita: Battle Angel", we can see a big transition in the advancement of AI and robotics for medical procedures. The use of AI and robotics in clinical practices displays many advantages such as a reduction in human error, more precise diagnosis, a reliable monitoring of a patient's progress. However, there were many legal and ethical factors that were raised when seeing AI and robots being used in medical assisted procedures and rehabilitation.

### Legal Aspects

A legal aspect that needs to be taken into account when introducing robots and AI into healthcare is liability if a problem occurs during a procedure. This is an important factor to take in consideration because an error or malfunction in the system can potentially cause physical harm to a patient or even harm to a clinician. This may also lead to ethical issues being addressed when deciding on who the responsibility lies with when there is a malfunction in the system that has caused harm to someone. Therefore, laws need to be put in place in order to protect patients' experience with robotics and AI healthcare and also allow for creators to think about ethical issues when making these AI systems and robots.

Another legal issue arising when considering using AI systems in healthcare is cybersecurity. This means that as technology progresses and patient's data is being processed, there is a risk of hackers who can steal patient's information or manipulate data. This also brings up ethical topics such as patient confidentiality and goes against one of the medical pillars, the patient's autonomy. Manipulated data in the AI algorithmic system can also cause harm to the patient's wellbeing due to misinformation from the corrupted system. This means laws need to be put in place to make sure data is being stored safely and there are good cybersecurity frameworks put in place.


### Ethical Aspects 

Although the use of AI and robotics in medical practices has a lot of advantages for healthcare in the future, it also raises ethical issues which needs to be taken into account. One ethical factor that needs to be considered when using a robotic surgical system is how informed consent is going to be incorporated in order to give the patients enough information to agree on whether they want to go through with a procedure. Another ethical issue we need to consider is the patients' surgeon and rehabilitation counsellor preference, although some people find it useful to use AI and robotics, some may have misconceptions about it, and some may just prefer to have a patient-clinician relationship. 

One factor that falls under the four pillars of medical ethics is justice which needs to be taken into account when creating algorithmic AI systems. This is because there could be a risk with AI being biased and therefore lead to discrimination due to the fact that human-trained algorithms could include datasets from a biased standpoint. 

Data privacy issues also need to be considered when dealing with AI in the medical field for patient confidentiality, which means patients need to be informed how and where their data is being used and also consent for their data to be used.
