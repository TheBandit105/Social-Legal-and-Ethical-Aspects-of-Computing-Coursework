## Issues arising from Military Usage of Robots

### Legal Aspects
One such legal issue that occurs when the robot is given a direct order by its commander to terminate the target is how the robot will respond to the order. Depending on the systems and algorithms that are built into such robots to identify the targets, the robot could simply disobey the order. For example, when a robot is commanded to target a house which is known to habour the enemy, it disobeys the order, since its vision sensors detected children inside the house and a programmed instruction tells the robot to minimise the civilian casualities. This can be seen as prejudging the order as the enemy could be using the children for malicious purposes and the robot wouldn't carry out the order.

Another legal issue that will be key is the security and regulations of the robots. For instance, the robot is commanded to follow an unauthorised order, such as killing a friendly soldier, or follow improper conduct, such as telling key information to the enemy. If these scenarios were to occur, the blame would be shared between the company who designed the robot and the person who maliciously used the robot for their personal gains.

In addition to this, sending robots to war could make it easier for a nation to engage in war, but at the same time, the robots could adopt violent foreign policies which could induce other nations to fight back. This means that the robots need to have regulations that will only prompt them to use combat force when it is absolutely necessary.

### Ethical Aspects
An ethical issue that arises from sending robots to war is its relationship with its human counterparts. The robots are likely to be built with video cameras and other sensory systems to note and report the events that took place on battlefield. These features could lead to mistrust between the human soldiers and the robot soldiers, as well as between the human soldiers themselves, which suggests that the cohesion amongst the team will be impacted.

Furthermore, giving the robots decision-making attributes during war situations means that the robots are more liable for any and every decision that they make. However, on the other hand, the robots would not have emotions, adrenaline and stress that would normally lead to wrong decisions and actions being made, meaning more ethically correctly decisions could be made much more quickly and efficiently than by a human soldier.

In addition to this, most war robots are normally sent out for urban operations, such as monitoring treacherous streets or implementing a curfew. These actions carried out by the war robots would most likely cause the local population to be less trustful of the robots and thus reduce the chance of developing good-will relationships with them. This will lead to the locals to insolently use the robots for their own needs rather than use it for human diplomacy. This leads to the question of the robot's effectiveness in persuading the other side to obtain peace that lasts.

### Social Aspects
One social issue that arises from sending robots to war is public trust in the robots. For many decades, many science fiction novels and movies, such as "Alita: Battle Angel", "Wall-E", "Iron Man" and "Transformers", have captured the imaginations of the public. However, all these works that utilise robots is in tension with the ethics and humankind's survivability, which instills concerns in the public about robots. By making technical advances in robotics, they are being incorporated into literary and theatrical works. This means that the worries that the public already have about robots will develop into close scrutiny of the robotics industry.

Whilst war robots can provide faster and more decisive victories than human soldiers can, the opponent will end up with increased defeats that are swifter than normal. This would raise the question if these increasing inequalities in warfare would lead to the opponents developing more desperate strategies and tactics to get the advantage over the country with the warfare. For instance, a country could end up increasing efforts to obtain nuclear or biochemical weapons.

There is also the issue of other countries of learning and eventually developing war robots of their own. Most countries are already doing this already, with some already leading the US in some respects. This leads to the query of how one should terminate this treacherous cycle of arms proliferation.

### Conclusion
Overall, war robots continue to be upgraded and carry more responsibility when placed in war scenarios. One important aspect that would be discussed will be about how the war robot will react to certain situations that come during a war. This is because the general public already have certain opinions on these types of robots and how they behave, based off the films and news media they've watched. Robots will gradually replace human soldiers over time and the each stage of the development of war robots will be carefully scrutinised and assessed.
