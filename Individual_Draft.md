## Issues arising from Police Usage of armed robots

### Legal aspects

A primary issue that arises when robots are permitted to detain individuals with force is the implications of how they come to conclusions that prompt them to use their destructive power. Depending on the algorithms within the robots to identify danger there could be implicit racism or bias from the training data which would lead to un-lawful acts or a prejudice to use force against a certain type of individual.

Another key legal implication is that a plethora of regulation will be required for the machines. The security of machine will be a major consideration, if an armed robot was hacked and became controlled by individuals with malicious purposes serious crimes could be committed. The blame would also be shared between the hacker and those who developed the security mechanism within the robot. On top of security regulations the quality of the weapons the robots possess will require significant regulation to ensure that robots are only given the amount of force necessary for a given situation. Data protection laws will also have to be enforced with these machines.

### Ethical aspects

With allowing robots the ability to derive conclusions as to whether or not to harm an individual in certain situations it provides robots with a larger responsibility than prior and with the lack of emotions robots are less like to be reasonable in specific situations where a human officer can make implicit deductions.

From the perspective of the public the law being enforced by machines could be daunting and create a larger divide between law enforcement and the public.
The article listed references this issue clearly.
> remote policing could worsen an "us-versus-them" divide.

Further to this point it portrays the law enforcement as a much more authoritarian environment and could lead others to fear government due to thoughts of dictatorships or corruption.

Utilisation of machines to replace a human operator in certain situations provides benefits; armed robots for situations that would normally require a SWAT team mean that there are likely to be fewer casualties on the side of the law enforcement. This must be considered and evaluated alongside the potentially side-effects of utilising machines. If a machine is more likely to resort to utilising weapons than a human operator whilst police members will not get injured it could lead to a larger amount of individuals injured by the police.
