## Challenges in robotic and AI assisted medical procedures and rehabilitations

### Legal Aspects


### Ethical Aspects 

Although the use of AI and robotics in medical practices has a lot of advantges for healthcare in the future, it also raises ethical issues which needs to be taken into account. One ethical factor that needs to be considered when using a robotic surgical system is how informed consent is going to be incoporated in order to give the patients enough information to agree on whether they want to go through with a procedure. Another ethical issue we need to consider is the patients' surgeon and rehabilitation counselor preference, although some people find it useful to use AI and robotics, some may have misconceptions about it and some may just prefer to have a patient-clinician relationship.
