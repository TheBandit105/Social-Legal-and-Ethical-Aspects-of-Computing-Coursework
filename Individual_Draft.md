## Issues arising from Police Usage of armed robots

As technology progresses and becomes more sophisticated their inclusion within societies increases. A key example of this is the involvement of autonomous machines within the police force. Whilst on the surface utilising machines seems reasonable issues arise as the tasks delegated to them becomes more involved. Machines armed with weapons creates a series of problems from both social, legal and ethical perspectives.

Alita: battle angel is a film set in the far future, within this reality there are autonomous machines living amongst humans like equals. Machines also take a large role within enforcing law within the society through means such as bounty hunting. The role machines have within Alita hold parallels with the potential roles machines are being considered for within our society providing a direct perspective of potential consequences of the adopting of advanced machinery within roles of high importance.

### Legal aspects

A primary issue that arises when robots are permitted to detain individuals with force is the implications of how they come to conclusions that prompt them to use their destructive power. Depending on the algorithms within the robots to identify danger there could be implicit racism or bias from the training data which would lead to un-lawful acts or a prejudice to use force against a certain type of individual.

Another key legal implication is that a plethora of regulation will be required for the machines. The security of machine will be a major consideration, if an armed robot was hacked and became controlled by individuals with malicious purposes serious crimes could be committed. The blame would also be shared between the hacker and those who developed the security mechanism within the robot. On top of security regulations the quality of the weapons the robots possess will require significant regulation to ensure that robots are only given the amount of force necessary for a given situation. Data protection laws will also have to be enforced with these machines.

If machines were given an even greater role within the police similar to one of the roles they occupy within Alita even more considerations would be needed with regards to the law and regulations. Due to the significance of fully-armed machines being given the role of goverment would potentially need to be considered on a global scale, the implication of machines sophisticated enough to reliably enforce law could potentially cause concern for other countries akin to the severity of nuclear weaponry.

### Ethical aspects

With allowing robots the ability to derive conclusions as to whether or not to harm an individual in certain situations it provides robots with a larger responsibility than prior and with the lack of emotions robots are less like to be reasonable in specific situations where a human officer can make implicit deductions.

From the perspective of the public the law being enforced by machines could be daunting and create a larger divide between law enforcement and the public.
The article listed references this issue clearly.
> remote policing could worsen an "us-versus-them" divide.

Further to this point it portrays the law enforcement as a much more authoritarian environment and could lead others to fear government due to thoughts of dictatorships or corruption.

Utilisation of machines to replace a human operator in certain situations provides benefits; armed robots for situations that would normally require a SWAT team mean that there are likely to be fewer casualties on the side of the law enforcement. This must be considered and evaluated alongside the potentially side-effects of utilising machines. If a machine is more likely to resort to utilising weapons than a human operator whilst police members will not get injured it could lead to a larger amount of individuals injured by the police.

Despite the ethical issues associated, to make a definitive decision on the suitability of inclusion of these armed machines the benefits the machines produce would also have to be evaluated. The key benefit of utilising armed robots within dangerous situations would be officers are in situations that could lead to injury less frequently. Similarly with machines being given a more substantial role within policing it provides human officers more time to focus on jobs that may have frequently gone overlooked before due to the priority it preventing crimes that could lead to loss in life.
