## Issues arising from Military Usage of Robots

### Legal Aspects
One such issue that occurs when the robot is given a direct order by its commander to terminate the target is how the robot will respond to the order. Depending on the systems and algorithms that are built into such robots to identify the targets, the robot could simply disobey the order. For example, when a robot is commanded to target a house which is known to habour the enemy, it disobeys the order, since its vision sensors detected children inside the house and a programmed instruction tells the robot to minimise the civilian casualities. This can be seen as prejudging the order as the enemy could using the children for malicious purposes and the robot wouldn't carry out the order.

Another legal issue that will be key is the security and regulations of the robots. For instance, the robot is commanded to follow an unauthorised order, such as killing a friendly soldier, or follow improper conduct, such as telling key information to the enemy. If these scenarios were to occur, the blame would be shared between the company who designed the robot and the person who maliciously used the robot for their personal gains.
In addition to this, sending robots to war could make it easier for a nation to engage in war, but at the same time, the robots could adopt violent foreign policies which could induce other nations to fight back. This means that the robots need to have regulations that will only prompt them to use combat force when it is absolutely necessary.
